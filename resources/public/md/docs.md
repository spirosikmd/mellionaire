## Leveraging Paylogic API

Mellionaire would not have been a reality without the excellent API built by the guys
at Paylogic :o)

More info about Paylogic API can be found
[here](http://doc-demo.staging.paylogic.nl/). Mellionaire uses the API for:

* `baskets` - to create baskets which contain tickets
* `orders` - to create orders and actually pay for them
* `events` - to get a list of events
* `tickets` - to create tickets and put them into baskets
* `merchants` - to get a list of merchants
* `products` - to get a list of products
* `locations` - to get information about places where events take place
* `etickets` - to download your etickets
* `profiles` - to represent personal information profiles

Mellionaire welcomes you to the amazing world of events!
